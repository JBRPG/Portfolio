                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    During Winter 2014 at Game Design Practicum in UC Santa Cruz,
                    I was taksed to develop a game for Windows Surface tablet device
                    within a 10 week quarter. I knew that a game with a simple scope
                    and easy to play experience were central to the creation of
                    the game Super Speedy Strategy Army Horde Tap-Tics (SSSAHT).
                    I decided to tackle RTS with local multiplayer and short play
                    sessions as key to developing the game. I also teamed up
                    with another student who specialized in game art so I handled
                    all of the game design and programming duties.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    The game was entirely made with Construct 2, a game engine
                    software with drag and drop programming user interface.
                    The main way to program anything is through event sheets,
                    which the order of events of actions matter from top to bottom.
                    The event sheets are normally used with the layout (game scene) that is tied to,
                    but thankfully it allows developers more advanced uses such as
                    including other event sheets as well as having global and local event variables.
                    A strategy I employ with event sheets is to have seperate groups
                    of entities or functinality under an event sheet such as player units,
                    items, and even functions and include those event sheets inside
                    the event sheet that runs the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, there is the layout view, which acts like a
                    scene / level editor to drag and drop objects onto the layout,
                    complete with arrangement and placement tools such as tiles,
                    layering, and more to ensure easy and rapid level design.
                    It also acts as the object creator whenever a new object is made on the scene.
                    The one slight nusiance when creating objects
                    is that they must all be present at the layout at run time, whether in bounds or not,
                    because Construct 2 cannot recognize objects that are stored anywhere else
                    except the layout when it comes to others that should not be present.
                    One trick to achieve removal of unneccessary objects is calling
                    the at runtime condition to remove the undesired objects should
                    there be other ways to spawn the objects that are erased at runtime.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Key features</h3>
                <h4>Simple Gameplay Elements</h4>
                <p>
                    By developing the game with light RTS elements on a mobile tablet,
                    I knew that simple gameplay, through touch alone,
                    would have to be key to an ejoyable yet chaotic experience.
                    The objective of being the last player standing instantly came to mind
                    because it is tried and true method for multiplayer competitive games.
                    I knew that I had to make 4 different units
                    that have its strengths, flaws, and gold cost to keep scope simple,
                    especially when it comes to 4 players with the same units.
                    Gold is automatically earned through time so players
                    can simply purchase units when when they have enough.
                    When the units are purchased, they go out the castle with
                    a predefined path along with arrow markers on split paths
                    so players can redirect their own as well as enemy units.
                    Additionally, I put down various items on the map
                    that any player an activate to give a sense of control and chaos,
                    so that it encourages a fun and frantic gameplay experience.
                </p>
                <h4>Compact Levels</h4>
                <p>
                    When making a local multiplayer game with light RTS elements,
                    all the levels had to take place on a single screen with a top-down
                    viewpoint, which influenced the art direction for the game
                    with iconic structures and moveable units. Additonally,
                    there had to be multiple maps based on number of players
                    to showcase different methods of conquering opponent's
                    castles, which meant desinging the various pathways,
                    showcasing which items get placed on the map with
                    unique uses and scenarios, and placement of the players'
                    castles and UI elements as if it were a game made for
                    cocktail screens.
                </p>
                <h4>Short Time Duration</h4>
                <p>
                    Having short time durations for play sessions were key
                    in repurposing light RTS elements for a more casual
                    and arcade-like experience. Keeping the gameplay simple
                    and accessible along with having levels small and compact
                    really helps reinforce the short play sessions.
                    When playtesting the game across the campus at various time settings
                    between 1, 2, and 3 minutes, people enjoyed playing at those
                    time settings since those times are well suited for
                    small breaks for anyone occupied with time.
                </p>
                <h3>Exporting to Windows Surface</h3>
                <p>
                    The process of exporting the game to Windows 8 store
                    with multi-touch support was an easy experience with a
                    few required steps. First, I created a Microsoft account
                    to register for Windows Store publishing tools.
                    Next, I had to export a build from Construct 2 with
                    target platform for Windows 8 with multi-touch
                    tablet support. Then I opened up Visual Studio
                    to run through the certification test. After all the tests pass,
                    I then proceeded to filling the requirements so that
                    the game is then published to the Windows Store.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    While it is rare for me to actually program games
                    that is not done by code, it did teach me a lot
                    about developing and publishing a game to a target
                    platform since it is a standard practice
                    to develop and release games for platforms
                    that is not PC, Mac, or Linux. I look
                    forward to continuing my game development skills
                    to hopefully release newer projects across
                    diverse platforms, whether it be console,
                    mobile, or other peripherals such as VR and AR devices.
